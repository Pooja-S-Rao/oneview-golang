# HPE OneView golang bindings

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Pooja-S-Rao/oneview-golang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Pooja-S-Rao/oneview-golang)

HPE OneView allows you to treat your physical infrastructure as code, and now
you can integrate your favorite tools based in golang with HPE OneView.

## Build requirements
We use docker to build and test, run this project on a system that has docker. 
If you don't use docker, you will need to install and setup go-lang locally as
well as any other make requirements.  You can use `USE_CONTAINER=false` environment
setting for make to avoid using docker. Otherwise make sure to have these tools:
- docker client and daemon
- gnu make tools

## Testing your changes

### From a container
```
make test
```

### Without docker
* Install golang 1.5 or better
* Install go packages listed in .travis.yml
```
USE_CONTAINER=false make test
```

## Changes to support HPE OneView API Version 201 and 300 :
1. In the /oneview-golang/liboneview folder inside the file api_support.go
  func (o APISupport) IsSupported(v Version) bool {
    switch o {
      case C_SERVER_HARDWAREV2:
      return (API_VER2 == v || API_VER2_1 == v || API_VER3 == v)      #To return true for the Server hardware of OneView API version
                                                                       201 and 300
      case C_PROFILE_TEMPLATES:
      return (API_VER2 == v || API_VER2_1 == v || API_VER3 == v) )    #To return true for the Profile template of OneView API version
                                                                       201 and 300
      default:
      return true
    }
  }
2.In the /oneview-golang/liboneview folder inside the file version.go
  a) # const (

3.In the /oneview-golang/ov folder inside the file profiles.go
#func (c *OVClient) CreateProfileFromTemplate(name string, template ServerProfile, blade ServerHardware) error {

    new_template, err = c.GetProfileByURI(template.URI)
    if err != nil {
      return err

  b) if ovversion >= 300 {   #If the OneView API Version is > = 300 then Server Profile type is "ServerProfileV6”
    new_template.Type = "ServerProfileV6”
    } else {    #If the OneView API Version is less than 300 then Server Profile type is "ServerProfileV5"

    } 
  c) //new_template.Type = "ServerProfileV5"   #The line number 284 in profiles.go has to remove because we have included in the if condition
